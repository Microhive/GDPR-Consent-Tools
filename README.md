# GDPR-Consent-Tools

This is a universty project in which I have attempted to develop a Roslyn Analyzer to assist in discovering business processes throughout a solution, and help annotate their purposes. This is then subsequently used to generate a consent list using Roslyn Code Fix analyzer.

You can find the associated Analyzers as a NuGet package here https://www.nuget.org/packages/GDPRConsentTools
